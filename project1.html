            <p style= "font-size: 20px"><strong> Hello! I'm Jonathan Baek. I was born in Seattle, WA and have been in the Puget Sound area all my life.</p>
            <p>(I don't have any pictures of myself as I don't usually take them! Sorry :D!)</p>

            <p style= "font-size: 20px">I currently work at SEA124 as a DCMA II and have been working with Amazon for a little over 2 years now. Outside of work, I enjoy watching anime/reading manga (ask for recommendations if you'd like!), going on walks, occasionally playing some video games, and cooking.</p>

        <p style= "font-size: 25px"><strong> There is a lot that I would still like to strive for in this life time, but the most important ones for me would likely be:
          <ul style= "font-size: 20px">

          <li>Get a better job &#128176;. As of this moment I have not chosen a specific career that I am working for, but I would like to hopefully find one that I am interested in by the end of this <a target="_blank" href="https://training.correlation-one.com/">course</a> (I wonder what this links to &#128128;).</li><br>

          <li>Learn to drive. I'm pretty late to the party, but I still have not learned to drive yet &#128517;. Hoping to cross this off by at least within a year!  </li><br>

          <li>Moving out and living on my own! This one follows suit of the ones before, but after being able to land a job, in which allows me to be more independent, I would like to move out and live on my own. Get a cat maybe &#128008;.<br> </li><br>

       <p style= "font-size: 20px">A recent venture of mine has been delving into the world of custom mechanical keyboards. <br>I enjoy both building them and consuming content revolving around the hobby. </p>
